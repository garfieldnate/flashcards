# TODO

Next: Proper design for cards/deck/stage

* Test with Jest
* navigation parameter validation
* validation in general (TypeScript?)
* Design everywhere!
* Overlay image on card swipes
* TypeScript
* Change to AGPL

srs notes:

* presentation order should be randomized; should not allow user to be primed by previous patterns
* failed first time cards should not be placed in the back of the stack
