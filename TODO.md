# TODO

Next: 

* if the list of decks to study is empty, render an "add decks" button instead of an empty ChooseStudyDeckScreen
* navigation parameter validation
* validation in general (TypeScript?)
* Design everywhere!
* Overlay image on card swipes

srs notes:

* presentation order should be randomized; should not allow user to be primed by previous patterns
* failed first time cards should not be placed in the back of the stack
